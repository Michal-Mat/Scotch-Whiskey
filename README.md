# Scotch-Whiskey
 In this repository I am trying to answer the following questions regarding the scotch dataset:
 
 Please provide meaningful insights, e.g.:
-	What interesting information user can find in the dataset? - (see EDA)
-	Choose whisky name and find other whisky(-ies) which you might like as well; Please provide reasoning of your steps – (see clustering)
-	How chosen whisky(-ies) can be perceived vs. other types? (see comparison to others)
-	What factors impact results the most? – (see classification and feature importances)

Requirements:
-	solution must contain comments (e.g. choice of model(s), assumptions, corrections, conclusions etc.) (comments in the jupyter)
-	solution written in python (especially Jupyter Notebook) (jupyter provided)
-	solution with commits history on the Github (history of commits available)
